# firestore-backup-scripts

Hi, go to notes and read them.

There are a couple of ways I experiment around for backing up Firestore.

**NOTE**: Firebase Firestore is not the same as Firebase Storage!!!

## Run my scripts

1. Compile with `tsc`
2. Prepare `.env` under root according to .env.template
3. Adjust parameters (with `"NOTE: CHANGE THIS"`) in each script to your preference
4. Run a script in folder `dist`
