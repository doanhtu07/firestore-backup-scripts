# firestore-backup-scripts

Hi, go to notes and read them.

There are a couple of ways I experiment around for backing up Firestore.

**NOTE**: Firebase Firestore is not the same as Firebase Storage!!!

## Run my scripts

1. Compile with `tsc`
2. Run a script in folder `dist` while you are at root of project so `dotenv` can pick up `.env`
